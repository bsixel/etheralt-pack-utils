# Etheralt Pack Utils
Minecraft mod running on Forge to provide extra features and compatibility for mods in my modpack Etheralt.
Currently adds the following integrations:
* Genetics Reborn
  * Tinker's Construct compatibility: If you have the infinity gene, it will now work with Tinker's bows and crossbows.
  * Nutrition compatibility: Eating grass is now nutritious! Or it can be. By default if you have the grass eating gene, grass will now provide 0.5% to every nutrient.
    Config provided to balance these numbers.
* Stargate Network (WIP)
  * Added example event handling for when a gate is created or removed. NOTE: must be running my fork of Stargate Network until it's been merged into the main AlmuraDev repo.
  * You can now find random books in vanilla structure that may contain up to 5 random addresses of Stargates that were generated by worldgen
  * Two commands - /sghelper list and /sghelper teleport. List will list all known stargates (including playermade ones), teleport will teleport you to a provided address. Note that the list command can also just be clicked to teleport to a gate.
* General utility commands: /utils <subcommand>
  * dispel - Removes active effects from the user
  * feed - Fills the user's hunger and saturation to 20 each.
  * fly - Lets the user fly, creative style
  * noClip - Toggles flying noclip for the user, similar to spectator mode but still able to interact with the world.
  * spawn - Teleports the user to their spawnpoint
