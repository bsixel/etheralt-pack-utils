# Etheralt Pack Utils
Minecraft mod running on Forge to provide extra features and compatibility for mods in my modpack Etheralt.
Currently adds the following integrations:
* Genetics Reborn
  * Tinker's Construct compatibility: If you have the infinity gene, it will now work with Tinker's bows and crossbows.
  * Nutrition compatibility: Eating grass is now nutritious! Or it can be. By default if you have the grass eating gene, grass will now provide 0.5% to every nutrient.
    Config provided to balance these numbers.
* Stargate Network (WIP)
  * Added example event handling for when a gate is created or removed. NOTE: must be running my fork of Stargate Network until it's been merged into the main AlmuraDev repo.
